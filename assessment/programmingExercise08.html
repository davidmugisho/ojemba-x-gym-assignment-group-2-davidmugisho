<!--
    PROGRAMMING EXERCISE 08:

    Create a new file called "programmingExercise08.js" in this directory. Add a JavaScript
    function that, when the Submit button is clicked, prints to console a string containing
    the first and last name of the user from the form below.
    Do not change this original HTML file.

    When you are done with this exercise, open this HTML file in your browser, open up the developers tools,
    and create a screenshot that proves that your function worked.
    Put the screenshot into this repository under the name "programmingExercise08.jpg" or "programmingExercise08.png".
