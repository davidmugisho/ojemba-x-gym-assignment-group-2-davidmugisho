<!--
    PROGRAMMING EXERCISE 09:

    Create a new file called "programmingExercise09.js" in this directory. Add a JavaScript
    function that hides the paragraph "Now you see me!" when the button "Hide" is clicked, and
    changes the text of the button to "Show". When the button is clicked again, the hidden paragraph
    shall be visible again, and the text of the button should be changed back to "Hide".
    Do not change this original HTML file.

    When you are done with this exercise, open this HTML file in your browser,
    and create two screenshots: One with the paragraph hidden, and one where it is not.
    Put the screenshot into this repository under the names
    - "programmingExercise09_hidden.jpg" or "programmingExercise09_hidden.png"
    - "programmingExercise09_visible.jpg" or "programmingExercise09_visible.png"
